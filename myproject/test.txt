Thesis :
The fact that men and women are different is well known. Some of these
difference are constant and some of them are not. Some of them were in
the past while some of will change in the future. But men and women are
similar in various aspects at the same time. Being in a country like India,
according to me, Men and women represent two forms of divine energy.
They are the male and female elements of the same soul.
DIfferrences:
In the past men are treated as the breadwinner of any family, whereas
women are meant for the kitchen and household work. Women were not
given any priority in the society. Things have changed right now. Despite of
this change, men and women have many striking contrasts between them.
Women became more interactive with the society, in fact they started
participating more actively in all of the social activities. They try to interact
so that they can build a complete picture in mind. Even the communication
centre in a woman’s brain is much larger than that of a man. While men, in
the other hand they see social interaction as a process to be an active
person.
Women in terms of anger management are much better than men. That is
because, women are better at recognizing angry faces than men. But at the
same time they are emotional too. Women can’t control few emotions such
as happiness and sadness.
Men can take decisions without being emotionally affected, while women
consider all the other factors related to emotion that most men overlook.
Similarities:
When it comes to intelligence men and women are almost equal. Even
science says that men and women have almost equal intelligence.
Both men and women show unconditional love towards their children and
beloved ones. They care for them without expecting anything in return.
In the past women were discriminated in terms of work, but now women are
men are doing almost all sorts of work with, women given equal priority with
men. There are women who work in underground mines and there are men
who design fashionable clothes for women and cook delicious food.
Personal Experience:
Few years ago, my sister got married and she was leaving with her
husband with her husband to start a new life. While my father was proud of
her daughter getting married, my mother was crying so deliberately as her
daughter is leaving her forever. Even my father had that emotion but he
was controlling it. Men also have equal emotions as women, but they tend
to control them.
Example from Streets of Laredo:
In the book, Peaeye who was loyal to his boss Captain Woodrow Call, had
to leave her wife Lorena and work for the captain. Here Peaeye shows how
men men be loyal and risk takers for the betterment of their family.
On the other hand Lorena didn't want Peaeye to leave as she was afraid of
him getting killed or injured. So this shows that women care about men but
from an emotional point of view.
Also, Ted Plunkert and Duby a similar situation arises. Ted wanted to go
but Duby is not happy with the decision. But Ted goes for it taking up the
risk. This shows that women are less risk takers when compared to men
think about the consequences also.
